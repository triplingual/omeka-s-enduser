## Terminology
**Admin/Administrative Dashboard**: the dashboard for administration of the entire OmekaS install, where sites, items, vocabularies, modules, etc are managed.

Also see the [glossary](docs/glossary.md)

## Formatting
Start each page with the following:

    # Name of the Page

Page file names should be lowercase with spaces represented by a dash (so admin-dashboard.md for Administrative Dashboard page). 

All relative links need to begin with .. (so .. / content / etc)

- Omeka S is written *with* a space between the Omeka and the S.
  - Possesive is Omeka S's
- Names of buttons in *italics*
- Names of options in *italics*
- Describe icons based on their tooltip, ex. edit (pencil icon), delete (trash can icon), details (ellipses icon). This way the text is useful for people using screen readers as well as those who are not.
- Add, Edit, and Delete processes should be described separately, each with their own heading. 
- Use H2 (##) for each subsection of a documentation page.
